# Gamebryo

## Summary

Yes, if you can believe it, it's another Game Boy emulator project! I have no
illusions of grandeur here, as the most this emulator will ever achieve is to
be used by a handful of people, and even that is a dream. No, this emulator is
more designed to be a learning exercise in understanding how hardware works and
how to emulate it through software, as well as manage and develop a medium-sized
software project. I'd like to cut my teeth on a simpler project so that I can
hopefully one day be able to contribute in a meaningful way to more sophisticated
emulation projects. Until then, I'll be making some not-so-graceful emulators of
my own.

Gamebryo is a Game Boy emulator written in C. I called it Gamebryo since it is 
very likely going to be an even more naive and primitive implementation of the 
Game Boy technology, thus it is an embryo rather than a boy. I chose the Game 
Boy since it seems the simplest of the video game consoles to attempt to emulate 
as a first foray into emulation. Later I hope to take what I learn from this 
project and make emulators for other consoles, the SNES being the pinnacle of 
such an effort as it is my favorite console.
