# Gamebryo

Gamebryo is a Game Boy emulator written in C++. I called it Gamebryo since it is very likely going to be an even more naive and primitive implementation of the Game Boy technology, thus it is an embryo rather than a boy. I chose the Game Boy since it seems the simplest of the video game consoles to attempt to emulate as a first foray into emulation. Later I hope to take what I learn from this project and make emulators for other consoles, the SNES being the pinnacle of such an effort as it is my favorite console.
